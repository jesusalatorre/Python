# Python
Learning process for Python

While not my strongest language, Python is a strong interest for me. This repo is a collection of projects and exercises I do to learn more about the language and its features.

These files are over a year old but were removed from my GitHub acc. a while ago. I managed to find them stored away so I figured I would put them back up here so I could build on the repo with more Python exercises I do.
